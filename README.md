This work assesses the energy footprints of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems and human drivers by four state-of-the-art energy demand and fuel consumption models, namely VT-micro, VSP, and ARRB. 

The assessment is performed on empirical data from two independent experimental car-following campaigns on similar driving cycles with and without using ACC. 

The study expands to a broader critical discussion around the energy footprint of ACC systems, trying to create a link with their driving characteristics compared to human drivers. 

The repository contains the AstaZero data set as well as a Jupyter notebook in Python that implements the four energy demand and fuel consumption models. Note that all data sets used in the paper are freely available via [OpenACC](http://data.europa.eu/89h/9702c950-c80f-4d2f-982f-44d06ea0009f).
